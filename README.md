As this is pretty much my first project I do think it is time to finish. Want to have 3 versions - Canadian capitals, US capitals, and the World Quiz - 2 small ones have data in lists but the World quiz opens a csv file and reads in the data - I'm looking at rewriting the logic as a Quiz class that I use in all three and adding some user score save and resume quiz option. Actually I'm shooting for a re-usable quiz class that will user input or selected data file with simple 2 field csv files - well documented that might be useful in intro classroom

May 2020 - re-write begins.
added suggestions as py files fix and fix1

Quiz – 2020 – May 

Goal of the code is to provide simple GUI multiple-choice quiz with three options – Canadian, US. or World Capitals Cities. Will need a player log in so as to capture high scores and quit and save buttons.

The Project has been complete in a primitive form with functions in python – work now is to re-write code and use Classes to clean up Global varibles in use. Rename single char. Variable more meaningfully and just generally clean up the code to a finished form.

Would like to add Flow-Chart, screen captures, etc. This document is intended for Readme on GitHub.

We have two lists states and cities for example -
