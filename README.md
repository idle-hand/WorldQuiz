returning to this project as I complete is in JavaScript while working on Speakeasy. Oct. 20 2022
This is my first Python project. Never time to finish. Wanted to have 3 versions - 

Canadian capitals, 
US capitals, 
and the World Quiz - 

2 small ones have data in lists but the World quiz opens a csv file and reads in the data - I was looking at rewriting the logic as a Quiz class to use in all three scripts.

Needs some user score save and resume quiz option. Actually I'm shooting for a re-usable quiz class that will user input or selected data file with simple 2 field csv files -

New Year 2022 - Project update and near completed.
Have Django quize running on pythonanywhere that will accomodate my requirements above. Just realized I could connect the 2 repos to and complete my intention for WorldQuiz and make use of exisiting django site.
