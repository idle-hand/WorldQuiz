- I  have 3 versions - Canadian capitals, US capitals, and the World Quiz - 2 small ones have data in lists but the World quiz opens a csv file and reads in the data - I'm looking at rewriting the logic as a Quiz class that I use in all three and adding some user score save and resume quiz option. Actually I'm shooting for a re-usable quiz class that will user input or selected data file with simple 2 field csv files - well documented that might be useful in intro classroom
